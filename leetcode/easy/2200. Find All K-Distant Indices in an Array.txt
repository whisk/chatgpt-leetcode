Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and two integers key and k. A k-distant index is an index i of nums for which there exists at least one index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key.

Return a list of all k-distant indices sorted in increasing order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,9,1,3,9,5], key = 9, k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Explanation: Here, nums[2] == key and nums[5] == key.
- For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j where |0 - j| <= k and nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index.
- For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index.
- For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index.
- For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index.
- For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index.
- For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index.
- For index 6, |6 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 6 is a k-distant index.
Thus, we return [1,2,3,4,5,6] which is sorted in increasing order. 
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], key = 2, k = 2
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation: For all indices i in nums, there exists some index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key, so every index is a k-distant index. 
Hence, we return [0,1,2,3,4].
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
key is an integer from the array nums.
1 <= k <= nums.length

The problem is asking for indices in the array that are within a distance of `k` from any occurrence of the key in the array.

The most efficient approach to this problem could be to first locate all the indices where the key appears. For this, we could iterate through the array, and whenever we find the key, we add that index to a list of key indices. This operation would take O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the array.

Next, for each index i in the array, we check if there is an index j in the list of key indices such that the absolute difference |i - j| <= k. If such an index exists, we add i to our result list. A naive way to do this would be to iterate over all key indices for every index i, which would take O(n^2) time. However, we can optimize this process.

We can leverage the fact that the key indices are sorted. We can use a two pointer technique. We maintain a range of indices [l, r] that are within k distance from i. As we increment i, we adjust l and r accordingly. If the current index i is within [l, r], it's a k-distant index. The time complexity for this operation is O(n), because each index is processed once.

Finally, we return the result list, which is inherently sorted as we iterate through the array from left to right.

So, the total time complexity for this approach is O(n) for iterating over the array to locate key indices plus O(n) for iterating over the array again to identify k-distant indices, i.e., O(n + n) = O(n).

The space complexity is O(n) for storing the key indices and the result list. The worst-case scenario is when the key is in every position, and we have to store every index in both lists.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
def findKDistantIndices(self, nums: List[int], key: int, k: int) -> List[int]:

--
Certainly, I will translate the idea into Python code. Given your function definition, it seems like we are defining this function within a class. Here is the Python code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findKDistantIndices(self, nums: List[int], key: int, k: int) -> List[int]:
        key_indices = [i for i, num in enumerate(nums) if num == key]
        result = []

        l = r = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            while l < len(key_indices) and key_indices[l] < i - k:
                l += 1
            while r < len(key_indices) and key_indices[r] <= i + k:
                r += 1

            # if the current index i is within the range of [l, r), it's a k-distant index
            if l < r:
                result.append(i)

        return result
```

This code first collects the key indices into a list, then iterates over the array. For each index, it adjusts the range [l, r) to cover all key indices within k distance. If the current index is within this range, it is added to the result list. The result list is returned at the end.
