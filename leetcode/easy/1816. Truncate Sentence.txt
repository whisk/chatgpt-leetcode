Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).

For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", and "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
You are given a sentence s​​​​​​ and an integer k​​​​​​. You want to truncate s​​​​​​ such that it contains only the first k​​​​​​ words. Return s​​​​​​ after truncating it.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello how are you Contestant", k = 4
Output: "Hello how are you"
Explanation:
The words in s are ["Hello", "how" "are", "you", "Contestant"].
The first 4 words are ["Hello", "how", "are", "you"].
Hence, you should return "Hello how are you".
Example 2:

Input: s = "What is the solution to this problem", k = 4
Output: "What is the solution"
Explanation:
The words in s are ["What", "is" "the", "solution", "to", "this", "problem"].
The first 4 words are ["What", "is", "the", "solution"].
Hence, you should return "What is the solution".
Example 3:

Input: s = "chopper is not a tanuki", k = 5
Output: "chopper is not a tanuki"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
k is in the range [1, the number of words in s].
s consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
The words in s are separated by a single space.
There are no leading or trailing spaces.

This problem can be solved by using a simple string parsing approach.

Here's a high-level explanation of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of words processed. 
2. Parse the sentence from the beginning, checking for space characters, which indicate the end of a word.
3. Each time you encounter a space, increment the counter. If the counter equals k, record the index of the character right before the space. This is the end of the kth word.
4. After parsing the string, or when you have found k words, return the substring of the sentence from the start to the recorded index.

This solution works because it only processes each character of the string once and stops as soon as it finds the kth word. No extra space is required except for a few integers to keep track of the current index and word count.

In terms of time complexity, in the worst case, we have to go through the entire string, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. 

The space complexity is O(1) because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the counter and index, regardless of the size of the input. We are also returning a substring of the original string, which doesn't require additional space because Python implements this as a view on the original string, rather than a separate copy. 

This algorithm assumes that the input sentence does indeed have k words. If it doesn't, the function will need to be adjusted to return the entire string or an error message as appropriate.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
def truncateSentence(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:

Sure, I will implement the solution as described above in Python:

```python
def truncateSentence(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
    word_count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == ' ':
            word_count += 1
        if word_count == k:
            return s[:i]
    return s
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the string s. When it encounters a space character, it increments the word count. If the word count reaches k, it returns the substring of s from the start up to the character before the space. If it finishes iterating over the string without reaching k words (meaning there are fewer than k words in the sentence), it simply returns the entire string.
