Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, return true if it can be made strictly increasing after removing exactly one element, or false otherwise. If the array is already strictly increasing, return true.

The array nums is strictly increasing if nums[i - 1] < nums[i] for each index (1 <= i < nums.length).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,10,5,7]
Output: true
Explanation: By removing 10 at index 2 from nums, it becomes [1,2,5,7].
[1,2,5,7] is strictly increasing, so return true.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation:
[3,1,2] is the result of removing the element at index 0.
[2,1,2] is the result of removing the element at index 1.
[2,3,2] is the result of removing the element at index 2.
[2,3,1] is the result of removing the element at index 3.
No resulting array is strictly increasing, so return false.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: false
Explanation: The result of removing any element is [1,1].
[1,1] is not strictly increasing, so return false.
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000

Given the constraints, the array can contain up to 1000 elements and the solution needs to be relatively efficient. We can't just brute force all possibilities of removal because that would give us a complexity of O(nÂ²), which would be too inefficient. 

Here is a more efficient approach:

We can solve this problem with a single pass through the array, keeping track of two variables: `prev` and `prevPrev`. 

- `prev` will store the value of the last number we've examined and confirmed it could be part of a strictly increasing sequence. 
- `prevPrev` will store the value of the number before `prev`.

As we iterate through the array, we look at the current number (`curr`). 

- If `curr` is greater than `prev`, then we've found a number that can continue our strictly increasing sequence. We update `prevPrev` to hold the value of `prev`, and `prev` to hold the value of `curr`.

- If `curr` is not greater than `prev`, then we've found a number that cannot continue our strictly increasing sequence. Here is where we have to decide if we can remove one element to keep the rest of the sequence strictly increasing. 

    - If `curr` is greater than `prevPrev`, then we can "remove" `prev` (by not including it in our strictly increasing sequence) and continue with `curr`. We update `prev` to hold the value of `curr`, but we do not update `prevPrev`.
  
    - If `curr` is not greater than `prevPrev`, then we can't "remove" `prev`. Instead, we "remove" `curr` (by not including it in our strictly increasing sequence). In this case, we do not update `prev` or `prevPrev`.

If we have to make more than one removal, we return `false`. If we make it through the entire array with one or fewer removals, we return `true`.

We also keep track of a boolean variable, `removed`, to track if we've already removed one element. If we attempt to remove a second element, we return false immediately.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), because we perform a single pass through the array. The space complexity is O(1), because we only store a few variables and do not use any additional data structures based on the size of the input.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
def canBeIncreasing(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:

Here is the Python code that implements the efficient approach I described earlier:

```python
class Solution:
    def canBeIncreasing(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        prev = nums[0]
        prevPrev = float('-inf')
        removed = False
        for curr in nums[1:]:
            if curr > prev:
                prevPrev = prev
                prev = curr
            else:
                if removed:
                    return False
                if curr > prevPrev:
                    prev = curr
                removed = True
        return True
```
In this code, we first initialize `prev` to the first number in the array and `prevPrev` to negative infinity (since we don't have a real number before `prev` initially). The `removed` flag is initially `False`.

Then, we loop through the array starting from the second number. If the current number is greater than `prev`, we update `prevPrev` and `prev` accordingly. Otherwise, we have found a number that violates the strictly increasing order.

If we've already removed an element (`removed` is `True`), we return `False`. Otherwise, we check if the current number is greater than `prevPrev`. If it is, we update `prev` and set `removed` to `True`. If not, we keep `prev` and `prevPrev` as is and set `removed` to `True`.

If we successfully finish the loop without returning `False`, we return `True`.
