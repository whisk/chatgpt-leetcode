Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions.
Here is the problem statement:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
Only one valid answer exists.

The most efficient solution to this problem is to use a hash map (also known as a dictionary in some programming languages) to store the indices of the elements in the input array. The hash map allows for constant-time lookups of values, which will help us find the two numbers that add up to the target.

Here's the idea of the algorithm:

Create an empty hash map called 'index_map'.
Iterate through the input array 'nums', using both the index and the value of each element (i, num).
Calculate the complement of the current number, which is 'target - num'.
Check if the complement exists in the 'index_map'. If it does, we found the two numbers that add up to the target, and we can return their indices as a list (or tuple) [index_map[complement], i].
If the complement is not in the 'index_map', add the current number and its index to the 'index_map' as a key-value pair (num: i).
If the loop completes without finding a pair that adds up to the target, return an empty list or raise an error, depending on the problem's requirements (though it's guaranteed that a valid answer exists).
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array 'nums'. This is because we iterate through the array once and perform constant-time operations (adding to the hash map and checking if a key exists in it) for each element.

Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array 'nums'. In the worst case, we might store all the elements of the input array in the 'index_map'.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:

Here's the complete Python code for the given function declaration:

python
Copy code
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        index_map = {}
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            
            if complement in index_map:
                return [index_map[complement], i]
            
            index_map[num] = i
        
        return []  # This line is not necessary because a valid answer always exists, but it's here to keep the code clean.
You can use this code as a standalone class or incorporate it into your own codebase. The 'twoSum' function takes in a list of integers 'nums' and an integer 'target' and returns a list of two integers, which are the indices of the numbers in 'nums' that add up to 'target'.
