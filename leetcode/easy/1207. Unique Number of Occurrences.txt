Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions.
Here is the problem statement:
Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 1000
-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a hash table (dictionary) to count the occurrences of each value in the array and another hash table to check for unique counts.

Here's the high-level algorithm:

Initialize an empty dictionary called 'counts' to store the occurrences of each value in the array.
Iterate through the array, and for each value, update its count in the 'counts' dictionary.
Initialize an empty dictionary called 'unique_counts' to store the unique counts of occurrences.
Iterate through the values in the 'counts' dictionary, and for each count, check if it is already present in 'unique_counts'. If it is, return false as the number of occurrences is not unique. Otherwise, add the count to 'unique_counts'.
If the loop completes, return true as all counts of occurrences are unique.
Time complexity: O(n) since we iterate through the array once to count occurrences and through the 'counts' dictionary once to check for unique counts. In the worst case, the 'counts' dictionary will have the same size as the array.

Memory complexity: O(n) as we use two dictionaries that store values and their counts. In the worst case, we'll store all unique values in the array and their counts, which would be equal to the array size.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. 
Here is the function declaration:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:

Here's the complete Python code for the given function definition:

python
Copy code
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        counts = {}
        unique_counts = {}
        
        # Count occurrences of each value in the array
        for value in arr:
            counts[value] = counts.get(value, 0) + 1
        
        # Check if counts of occurrences are unique
        for count in counts.values():
            if count in unique_counts:
                return False
            else:
                unique_counts[count] = True
                
        return True
This code follows the algorithm I explained earlier and should work for the given problem statement.
