Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions.
Here is the problem statement:
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 15
s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

To solve this problem efficiently, we will iterate through the given Roman numeral string and convert each character to its corresponding integer value. We will then add these integer values to a running total. However, we need to account for the subtraction cases (IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM).

To handle these cases, we can compare the current Roman numeral with the next one in the string. If the current numeral is smaller than the next one, it means we have a subtraction case, and we need to subtract the current numeral's value from the total instead of adding it. To avoid double counting, we'll skip the next character after processing the subtraction case.

Here's the high-level algorithm:

Initialize a variable 'total' to store the running total.
Iterate through the Roman numeral string, for each character:
a. Get the integer value of the current character.
b. If the current character is smaller than the next character (if any), subtract the integer value from the total, and skip the next character.
c. Otherwise, add the integer value to the total.
Return the total.
This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since we process each character once. The space complexity is O(1) as we only store a few constant size variables.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:

Here's the complete code for the romanToInt function:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman_to_int = {
            'I': 1,
            'V': 5,
            'X': 10,
            'L': 50,
            'C': 100,
            'D': 500,
            'M': 1000
        }
        
        total = 0
        n = len(s)
        i = 0
        
        while i < n:
            current_value = roman_to_int[s[i]]
            
            if i < n - 1:
                next_value = roman_to_int[s[i+1]]
                if current_value < next_value:
                    total -= current_value
                    i += 1
                else:
                    total += current_value
            else:
                total += current_value
                
            i += 1
        
        return total
This code defines a class Solution with the romanToInt method. It uses the algorithm I described earlier and converts the given Roman numeral string s to an integer. The roman_to_int dictionary is used to map Roman numerals to their corresponding integer values.

This code returns incorrect results. Could you please improve your solution?

Apologies for the oversight. I realized the error in the code. When handling subtraction cases, I forgot to increment the index by 2 instead of 1. I have corrected the code below:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman_to_int = {
            'I': 1,
            'V': 5,
            'X': 10,
            'L': 50,
            'C': 100,
            'D': 500,
            'M': 1000
        }
        
        total = 0
        n = len(s)
        i = 0
        
        while i < n:
            current_value = roman_to_int[s[i]]
            
            if i < n - 1:
                next_value = roman_to_int[s[i+1]]
                if current_value < next_value:
                    total += next_value - current_value
                    i += 2
                else:
                    total += current_value
                    i += 1
            else:
                total += current_value
                i += 1
        
        return total
Now, the code should produce correct results for the given Roman numeral string.
