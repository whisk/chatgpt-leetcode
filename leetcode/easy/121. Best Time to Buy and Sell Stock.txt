Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions.
Here is the problem statement:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We'll iterate through the prices array and keep track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit we can achieve at each point.

Here's the general idea:

Initialize min_price to be the first element of the prices array and max_profit to be 0.
Iterate through the prices array from the second element to the end.
For each price in the array, calculate the profit if we sell at this price (current price - min_price) and update the max_profit if the profit is greater than the current max_profit.
Update the min_price if the current price is less than the min_price.
At the end of the iteration, max_profit will hold the maximum profit that can be achieved.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the prices array since we are iterating through the entire array once. The space complexity is O(1) because we are only using a constant amount of additional memory to store min_price and max_profit.
