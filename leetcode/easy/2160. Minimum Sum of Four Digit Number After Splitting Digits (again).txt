Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:
You are given a positive integer num consisting of exactly four digits. Split num into two new integers new1 and new2 by using the digits found in num. Leading zeros are allowed in new1 and new2, and all the digits found in num must be used.

For example, given num = 2932, you have the following digits: two 2's, one 9 and one 3. Some of the possible pairs [new1, new2] are [22, 93], [23, 92], [223, 9] and [2, 329].
Return the minimum possible sum of new1 and new2.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 2932
Output: 52
Explanation: Some possible pairs [new1, new2] are [29, 23], [223, 9], etc.
The minimum sum can be obtained by the pair [29, 23]: 29 + 23 = 52.
Example 2:

Input: num = 4009
Output: 13
Explanation: Some possible pairs [new1, new2] are [0, 49], [490, 0], etc. 
The minimum sum can be obtained by the pair [4, 9]: 4 + 9 = 13.
 

Constraints:

1000 <= num <= 9999

The most efficient solution for this problem is to first separate the digits of the given number and sort them in ascending order. Then, create two new numbers by taking alternating digits from the sorted list. By doing this, we can ensure that we are constructing the smallest possible numbers which will result in the minimum sum.

Here's a high-level algorithm for the problem:

Convert the given number into a list of digits.
Sort the list of digits in ascending order.
Initialize two new numbers: new1 and new2.
Iterate through the sorted list of digits:
a. For even indices, append the digit to new1.
b. For odd indices, append the digit to new2.
Calculate the sum of new1 and new2 and return the result.
Time complexity analysis:
Step 1 takes O(1) time since the input number has exactly four digits.
Step 2 takes O(1) time as well since there are only four digits to sort.
Step 3 takes O(1) time.
Step 4 takes O(1) time since we iterate through a fixed number of four digits.
Step 5 takes O(1) time.

So, the overall time complexity of this algorithm is O(1).

Memory complexity analysis:
We need to store the list of digits, which takes O(1) space.
We also need to store new1 and new2, which takes O(1) space.

So, the overall memory complexity of this algorithm is O(1).

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
    def minimumSum(self, num: int) -> int:
Here's the Python implementation of the algorithm based on the function declaration you provided:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def minimumSum(self, num: int) -> int:
        # Convert the given number into a list of digits and sort them in ascending order
        digits = sorted([int(d) for d in str(num)])

        # Initialize two new numbers: new1 and new2
        new1, new2 = 0, 0

        # Iterate through the sorted list of digits
        for i, digit in enumerate(digits):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # For even indices, append the digit to new1
                new1 = new1 * 10 + digit
            else:  # For odd indices, append the digit to new2
                new2 = new2 * 10 + digit

        # Calculate the sum of new1 and new2 and return the result
        return new1 + new2
You can use the Solution class to call the minimumSum method with the desired input number:

python
Copy code
solution = Solution()
result = solution.minimumSum(2932)
print(result)  # Output: 52
