Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, return the number of distinct quadruplets (a, b, c, d) such that:

nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] == nums[d], and
a < b < c < d
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,6]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only quadruplet that satisfies the requirement is (0, 1, 2, 3) because 1 + 2 + 3 == 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3,6,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no such quadruplets in [3,3,6,4,5].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 quadruplets that satisfy the requirement are:
- (0, 1, 2, 3): 1 + 1 + 1 == 3
- (0, 1, 3, 4): 1 + 1 + 3 == 5
- (0, 2, 3, 4): 1 + 1 + 3 == 5
- (1, 2, 3, 4): 1 + 1 + 3 == 5
 

Constraints:

4 <= nums.length <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

Here's an approach to solving this problem:

1. We start by iterating over the array from the last index towards the first. This will be our potential `nums[d]`.

2. For each `nums[d]`, we then need to find the number of triplets `(a,b,c)` in the remaining subarray `nums[0]` to `nums[d-1]` that sums up to `nums[d]`.

3. We can maintain a hashmap to count the number of pairs `(b,c)` for each possible sum in the remaining subarray. 

4. For each `nums[a]`, we then check in our hashmap if there is an entry for `nums[d] - nums[a]`. If there is, we add that count to our answer.

5. After checking for all possible `a`, we then update our hashmap with all possible pairs `(b,c)` that include `nums[a]`. We do this by iterating over all `nums[b]` in the remaining subarray and adding 1 to the count of `nums[a] + nums[b]` in our hashmap.

6. After we finish processing `nums[a]`, we move to the next `nums[d]` and repeat the process.

7. In the end, our answer is the total count of all quadruplets we found.

In terms of time complexity, we have a nested loop: the outer loop goes through each element in the array, and for each element, we iterate over the remaining elements in the array. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the hashmap that could potentially store a pair count for each pair of elements in the array.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
    def countQuadruplets(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

Sure, here is a Python solution based on the approach described above. It's important to remember that Python list indices are 0-based.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countQuadruplets(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        result = 0
        # Initialize the hashmap with default value 0
        pair_sums = {}
        # Iterate over nums[d] from last to first
        for d in range(n - 1, 2, -1):
            # For each nums[a], check if there is a pair (b,c) that sums to nums[d] - nums[a]
            for a in range(d - 1, -1, -1):
                if nums[d] - nums[a] in pair_sums:
                    result += pair_sums[nums[d] - nums[a]]
            # Update pair_sums with all pairs (b,c) that includes nums[d - 1]
            for b in range(d - 2, -1, -1):
                if nums[b] + nums[d - 1] not in pair_sums:
                    pair_sums[nums[b] + nums[d - 1]] = 0
                pair_sums[nums[b] + nums[d - 1]] += 1
        return result
```

The outer loop over `d` iterates `n` times, and for each `d`, there are two inner loops over `a` and `b` that also iterate `n` times each, so the time complexity is indeed O(n^2). The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the `pair_sums` dictionary.

This code returns incorrect results. Could you please improve your solution?

I apologize for the confusion. You're right, the code was incorrect because we were updating the `pair_sums` too soon. We need to update the `pair_sums` after processing all possible `a` for each `d`.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countQuadruplets(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        result = 0
        # Initialize the hashmap with default value 0
        pair_sums = {}
        # Iterate over nums[d] from last to first
        for d in range(n - 1, 2, -1):
            # For each nums[a], check if there is a pair (b,c) that sums to nums[d] - nums[a]
            for a in range(d - 1, -1, -1):
                if nums[d] - nums[a] in pair_sums:
                    result += pair_sums[nums[d] - nums[a]]
            # Update pair_sums with all pairs (b,c) that includes nums[d - 1]
            # but only after we've finished processing all possible a for the current d
            for b in range(d - 2, -1, -1):
                for c in range(b + 1, d):
                    if nums[b] + nums[c] not in pair_sums:
                        pair_sums[nums[b] + nums[c]] = 0
                    pair_sums[nums[b] + nums[c]] += 1
        return result
```

Now, we update `pair_sums` only after we've finished processing all possible `a` for each `d`. This ensures that we do not count quadruplets where `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all less than `d`.

The time complexity of the solution is now O(n^3) due to the triple nested loop, but it should still be feasible given the problem constraints (4 <= nums.length <= 50). The space complexity remains O(n^2).
