Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. An index i is part of a hill in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are smaller than nums[i]. Similarly, an index i is part of a valley in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are larger than nums[i]. Adjacent indices i and j are part of the same hill or valley if nums[i] == nums[j].

Note that for an index to be part of a hill or valley, it must have a non-equal neighbor on both the left and right of the index.

Return the number of hills and valleys in nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,4,1,1,6,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At index 0: There is no non-equal neighbor of 2 on the left, so index 0 is neither a hill nor a valley.
At index 1: The closest non-equal neighbors of 4 are 2 and 1. Since 4 > 2 and 4 > 1, index 1 is a hill. 
At index 2: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 2 is a valley.
At index 3: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 3 is a valley, but note that it is part of the same valley as index 2.
At index 4: The closest non-equal neighbors of 6 are 1 and 5. Since 6 > 1 and 6 > 5, index 4 is a hill.
At index 5: There is no non-equal neighbor of 5 on the right, so index 5 is neither a hill nor a valley. 
There are 3 hills and valleys so we return 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,6,5,5,4,1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
At index 0: There is no non-equal neighbor of 6 on the left, so index 0 is neither a hill nor a valley.
At index 1: There is no non-equal neighbor of 6 on the left, so index 1 is neither a hill nor a valley.
At index 2: The closest non-equal neighbors of 5 are 6 and 4. Since 5 < 6 and 5 > 4, index 2 is neither a hill nor a valley.
At index 3: The closest non-equal neighbors of 5 are 6 and 4. Since 5 < 6 and 5 > 4, index 3 is neither a hill nor a valley.
At index 4: The closest non-equal neighbors of 4 are 5 and 1. Since 4 < 5 and 4 > 1, index 4 is neither a hill nor a valley.
At index 5: There is no non-equal neighbor of 1 on the right, so index 5 is neither a hill nor a valley.
There are 0 hills and valleys so we return 0.
 

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

To solve this problem efficiently, we can iterate through the array once and keep track of the hills and valleys. As we iterate through the array, we will check if the current index is part of a hill or valley.

Initialize a variable count to store the count of hills and valleys, and set it to 0.
Iterate through the array from index 1 to index n - 2 (where n is the length of the array).
a. If the current element is not equal to the previous element and the next element, perform the following steps:
i. If the current element is greater than both the previous and next elements, increment count (since it's a hill).
ii. If the current element is smaller than both the previous and next elements, increment count (since it's a valley).
Return the count variable.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of additional space to store the count variable.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
    def countHillValley(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
Here is the Python code for the given function declaration:

python
Copy code
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countHillValley(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        n = len(nums)

        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if nums[i] != nums[i - 1] and nums[i] != nums[i + 1]:
                if nums[i] > nums[i - 1] and nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
                    count += 1
                elif nums[i] < nums[i - 1] and nums[i] < nums[i + 1]:
                    count += 1

        return count
This code follows the algorithm I described earlier and should work for the given problem statement.

This code returns incorrect results. Could you please improve your solution?

I apologize for the oversight in my previous solution. I didn't account for the "closest non-equal neighbors" condition properly. Here's an updated implementation:

python
Copy code
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countHillValley(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        n = len(nums)

        def find_prev_non_equal(i):
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                if nums[j] != nums[i]:
                    return j
            return -1

        def find_next_non_equal(i):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if nums[j] != nums[i]:
                    return j
            return n

        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            prev_idx = find_prev_non_equal(i)
            next_idx = find_next_non_equal(i)

            if prev_idx != -1 and next_idx != n:
                if nums[i] > nums[prev_idx] and nums[i] > nums[next_idx]:
                    count += 1
                elif nums[i] < nums[prev_idx] and nums[i] < nums[next_idx]:
                    count += 1

        return count
This code first finds the closest non-equal neighbors for each index i by using two helper functions find_prev_non_equal() and find_next_non_equal(). Then, it checks if the current index i is part of a hill or valley by comparing the current element with the closest non-equal neighbors.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) in the worst case, as for each index, we might have to iterate through the entire array to find the closest non-equal neighbors. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of additional space to store the count variable.
