Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:
You are given a positive integer num. You may swap any two digits of num that have the same parity (i.e. both odd digits or both even digits).

Return the largest possible value of num after any number of swaps.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 1234
Output: 3412
Explanation: Swap the digit 3 with the digit 1, this results in the number 3214.
Swap the digit 2 with the digit 4, this results in the number 3412.
Note that there may be other sequences of swaps but it can be shown that 3412 is the largest possible number.
Also note that we may not swap the digit 4 with the digit 1 since they are of different parities.
Example 2:

Input: num = 65875
Output: 87655
Explanation: Swap the digit 8 with the digit 6, this results in the number 85675.
Swap the first digit 5 with the digit 7, this results in the number 87655.
Note that there may be other sequences of swaps but it can be shown that 87655 is the largest possible number.
 

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 10^9

To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:

Convert the given integer 'num' to a list of its digits.
Create two separate lists for even and odd digits.
Sort both the even and odd digits lists in descending order.
Create a new list for the final result.
Iterate through the original list of digits, and for each digit, check its parity (odd/even).
For each digit, if it is even, pop the largest even digit from the sorted even digits list and append it to the result list; if it is odd, pop the largest odd digit from the sorted odd digits list and append it to the result list.
Convert the final result list back to an integer and return it.
The time complexity of this solution is O(nlogn), where n is the number of digits in the given integer 'num'. This is because we need to sort both the even and odd digits lists, and sorting has a time complexity of O(nlogn). The memory complexity is O(n), as we need to store the lists of even and odd digits as well as the final result list.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
    def minimumSum(self, num: int) -> int:
Here is the Python code for the given problem statement:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def minimumSum(self, num: int) -> int:
        # Convert the given integer 'num' to a list of its digits
        num_list = list(str(num))
        
        # Create two separate lists for even and odd digits
        even_digits = [int(d) for d in num_list if int(d) % 2 == 0]
        odd_digits = [int(d) for d in num_list if int(d) % 2 != 0]
        
        # Sort both the even and odd digits lists in descending order
        even_digits.sort(reverse=True)
        odd_digits.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Create a new list for the final result
        result_list = []
        
        # Iterate through the original list of digits
        for d in num_list:
            if int(d) % 2 == 0:  # Check if the digit is even
                result_list.append(str(even_digits.pop(0)))  # Pop the largest even digit and append it to the result list
            else:
                result_list.append(str(odd_digits.pop(0)))  # Pop the largest odd digit and append it to the result list
        
        # Convert the final result list back to an integer and return it
        return int(''.join(result_list))
You can use this code as a part of the Solution class. The function minimumSum takes an integer 'num' as input and returns the largest possible value of num after any number of allowed swaps.
