Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:
Given an integer array nums, return the number of non-empty subarrays with the leftmost element of the subarray not larger than other elements in the subarray.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,2,5,3]
Output: 11
Explanation: There are 11 valid subarrays: [1],[4],[2],[5],[3],[1,4],[2,5],[1,4,2],[2,5,3],[1,4,2,5],[1,4,2,5,3].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 valid subarrays are: [3],[2],[1].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,2,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 valid subarrays: [2],[2],[2],[2,2],[2,2],[2,2,2].
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

This problem can be solved using a decreasing monotonic stack and dynamic programming. 

First, let's understand what a decreasing monotonic stack is. It's a stack where the elements are in descending order from bottom to top. The bottom-most element is the largest and the top-most element is the smallest.

Now, let's get to the solution. We initialize an array dp of the same length as nums. dp[i] will store the number of valid subarrays ending at index i. We also initialize an empty stack. 

We then iterate over the nums array from left to right. For each element, while the stack is not empty and the current element is greater than or equal to the top element of the stack, we pop the stack. This is because the current element is larger than or equal to the previous elements, so it can form a new subarray with the elements before it. 

We then update dp[i] as i - stack[-1] if the stack is not empty, else i + 1. This is because the number of valid subarrays ending at i is the distance from i to the nearest larger number on its left (which is the top of the stack), if any, else it's all the numbers from the start to i. 

We then push i onto the stack and move to the next element. 

Finally, the sum of all elements in dp will be the answer. 

This approach works because we use the stack to find the nearest larger number on the left of each element, which is the key to forming valid subarrays. 

As for time complexity, we have a single loop over the nums array, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of nums. Note that while there are push and pop operations within the loop, each element is pushed and popped exactly once, so it's still O(n) overall. 

The space complexity is also O(n), as we use extra space for the stack and dp array. 

Please let me know if I should write out the code or if there's anything you'd like me to explain further.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
def validSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

Sure, based on the solution explanation above, here is the Python code for this problem:

```python
def validSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    stack = []
    dp = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and nums[i] >= nums[stack[-1]]:
            stack.pop()
        
        if stack:
            dp[i] = i - stack[-1]
        else:
            dp[i] = i + 1
        
        stack.append(i)
    
    return sum(dp)
```

This function starts by initializing the variables: `n` is the length of `nums`, `stack` is an empty list to be used as a stack, and `dp` is a list of zeroes with the same length as `nums`.

Then, it iterates over `nums`. For each element, it pops the stack until the top element of the stack is larger than the current element. Then it updates `dp[i]` based on whether the stack is empty or not. Finally, it pushes the current index onto the stack.

The function returns the sum of all elements in `dp`, which is the total number of valid subarrays.

This function assumes that `nums` is a list of integers and returns an integer.

This code returns incorrect results. Could you please improve your solution?

My apologies for the confusion. In the previous approach, I misunderstood the condition for updating the dp array. Let's revise the approach and the Python code as follows:

A valid subarray is a non-empty subarray where the leftmost (first) element is not larger than the other elements. So, for each position i in the array, we need to find how many valid subarrays end at this position. If nums[j] is the leftmost element of the subarray ending at i (j <= i), it needs to be less than or equal to all other elements in the subarray, i.e., it needs to be the minimum from nums[j] to nums[i].

The key idea to solve this problem efficiently is to notice that if nums[i] >= nums[i-1], then all subarrays ending at i-1 are also valid subarrays ending at i, plus one additional subarray [nums[i]]. This is because nums[i] is greater than or equal to the leftmost element of all subarrays ending at i-1 (which is their minimum), so we can extend all these subarrays by nums[i].

Based on this idea, we initialize a counter to 0, then iterate the nums array from left to right. For each nums[i], if it's greater than or equal to nums[i-1], we increment a local counter by 1, else we reset the local counter to 1, then we add the local counter to the total counter.

Here is the revised Python code:

```python
def validSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    total, local = 0, 0

    for i in range(n):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] >= nums[i-1]:
            local += 1
        else:
            local = 1
        total += local

    return total
```

This function starts by initializing the total and local counters to 0. Then it iterates over nums. For each nums[i], if it's greater than or equal to nums[i-1], it increments the local counter by 1, else it resets the local counter to 1. Then it adds the local counter to the total counter. The function returns the total counter, which is the total number of valid subarrays.

This function assumes that nums is a list of integers and returns an integer.

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of nums, because there is a single loop over nums. The space complexity is O(1), because the extra space used does not grow with the size of nums.
