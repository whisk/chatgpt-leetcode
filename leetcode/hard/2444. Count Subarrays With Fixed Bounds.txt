Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:

You are given an integer array nums and two integers minK and maxK.

A fixed-bound subarray of nums is a subarray that satisfies the following conditions:

The minimum value in the subarray is equal to minK.
The maximum value in the subarray is equal to maxK.
Return the number of fixed-bound subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,2,7,5], minK = 1, maxK = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The fixed-bound subarrays are [1,3,5] and [1,3,5,2].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1], minK = 1, maxK = 1
Output: 10
Explanation: Every subarray of nums is a fixed-bound subarray. There are 10 possible subarrays.
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i], minK, maxK <= 10^6

To solve this problem, we can use the sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a window of contiguous elements in the array, and slide the window as we iterate through the array. We will keep track of the indices of the minimum and maximum elements within the window.

Here are the steps:

Initialize two pointers, left and right, both initially set to the first index of the array.
Initialize a count variable to store the number of fixed-bound subarrays.
Iterate through the array using the right pointer:
a. If the current element at the right pointer is within the minK and maxK range, continue to the next step. Otherwise, move the left pointer to the right pointer's position and continue to the next iteration.
b. Find the minimum and maximum elements within the window (between the left and right pointers).
c. If the minimum element equals minK and the maximum element equals maxK, increment the count variable.
d. Increment the right pointer.
Return the count variable.
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the array nums. This is because we have a single loop that iterates through the array, and the sliding window ensures that we only visit each element once.

The memory complexity is O(1), as we only need to store a constant number of variables: left, right, count, minElement, and maxElement.

Note that finding the minimum and maximum elements within the window can be optimized by using a data structure like a deque, but the overall time complexity of the algorithm will still be O(n).

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], minK: int, maxK: int) -> int:

Here's the Python code for the given problem:

python
Copy code
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], minK: int, maxK: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = 0
        count = 0

        while right < len(nums):
            # If the current element is within the minK and maxK range
            if minK <= nums[right] <= maxK:
                # Find the minimum and maximum elements within the window
                minElement = min(nums[left:right + 1])
                maxElement = max(nums[left:right + 1])

                # Check if the minimum and maximum elements satisfy the condition
                if minElement == minK and maxElement == maxK:
                    count += 1

                # Increment the right pointer
                right += 1

            else:
                # Move the left pointer to the right pointer's position
                left = right + 1
                right = left

        return count
This code implements the solution using the sliding window technique as described earlier. The function takes an array of integers nums, and two integers minK and maxK, and returns the number of fixed-bound subarrays.

This code returns incorrect results. Could you please improve your solution?

I apologize for the confusion. I realize now that I misunderstood the problem statement. Let me provide an updated solution.

We can solve this problem using the two-pointer technique. We will need two pointers, left and right. We will also maintain two counts, count_minK and count_maxK, to track the number of subarrays ending at the right pointer with the minimum value equal to minK and the maximum value equal to maxK, respectively.

Here's the updated solution:

Initialize two pointers, left_minK and left_maxK, both initially set to 0.
Initialize two count variables, count_minK and count_maxK, both initially set to 0.
Initialize the result variable to store the number of fixed-bound subarrays.
Iterate through the array using the right pointer:
a. Update count_minK and count_maxK.
b. Move left_minK and left_maxK pointers accordingly to maintain the conditions.
c. Increment the result variable by count_minK.
d. Increment the right pointer.
Return the result variable.
Here's the Python code implementing the updated solution:

python
Copy code
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], minK: int, maxK: int) -> int:
        left_minK = left_maxK = 0
        count_minK = count_maxK = 0
        result = 0

        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right] == minK:
                count_minK = right - left_minK + 1
            elif nums[right] < minK:
                count_minK = 0
                left_minK = right + 1
            
            if nums[right] == maxK:
                count_maxK = right - left_maxK + 1
            elif nums[right] > maxK:
                count_maxK = 0
                left_maxK = right + 1

            result += count_minK - count_maxK

        return result
This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array nums, as we iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only store a constant number of variables.
