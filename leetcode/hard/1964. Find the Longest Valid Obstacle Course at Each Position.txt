Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:
You want to build some obstacle courses. You are given a 0-indexed integer array obstacles of length n, where obstacles[i] describes the height of the ith obstacle.

For every index i between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), find the length of the longest obstacle course in obstacles such that:

You choose any number of obstacles between 0 and i inclusive.
You must include the ith obstacle in the course.
You must put the chosen obstacles in the same order as they appear in obstacles.
Every obstacle (except the first) is taller than or the same height as the obstacle immediately before it.
Return an array ans of length n, where ans[i] is the length of the longest obstacle course for index i as described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: obstacles = [1,2,3,2]
Output: [1,2,3,3]
Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
- i = 0: [1], [1] has length 1.
- i = 1: [1,2], [1,2] has length 2.
- i = 2: [1,2,3], [1,2,3] has length 3.
- i = 3: [1,2,3,2], [1,2,2] has length 3.
Example 2:

Input: obstacles = [2,2,1]
Output: [1,2,1]
Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
- i = 0: [2], [2] has length 1.
- i = 1: [2,2], [2,2] has length 2.
- i = 2: [2,2,1], [1] has length 1.
Example 3:

Input: obstacles = [3,1,5,6,4,2]
Output: [1,1,2,3,2,2]
Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
- i = 0: [3], [3] has length 1.
- i = 1: [3,1], [1] has length 1.
- i = 2: [3,1,5], [3,5] has length 2. [1,5] is also valid.
- i = 3: [3,1,5,6], [3,5,6] has length 3. [1,5,6] is also valid.
- i = 4: [3,1,5,6,4], [3,4] has length 2. [1,4] is also valid.
- i = 5: [3,1,5,6,4,2], [1,2] has length 2.
 

Constraints:

n == obstacles.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= obstacles[i] <= 10^7

The problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming and binary search. The idea is to maintain a list `dp` where dp[i] represents the minimum height of the last obstacle in an increasing subsequence of length i+1. We initialize the list `dp` with a large value to facilitate the comparisons. As we iterate through the obstacles, we find the position to insert the obstacle height in the `dp` list using binary search. This position will be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at the current obstacle. We then update the `dp` list with the height of the current obstacle.

Here's a high-level algorithm for the problem:

1. Initialize an empty list `dp` of size n filled with a large value.
2. Initialize an empty list `ans` of size n to store the results.
3. Iterate through the given `obstacles` array.
   a. For each obstacle, find the index `idx` in the `dp` list where it should be inserted using binary search.
   b. Update `dp[idx]` with the height of the current obstacle.
   c. Store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at the current obstacle (idx + 1) in the `ans` list.
4. Return the `ans` list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * log n), as we perform a binary search for each of the n obstacles. The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the `dp` and `ans` lists of length n.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
    def longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(self, obstacles: List[int]) -> List[int]:

Sure, I will implement the solution in Python as per the function declaration you've provided. We need to use `bisect.bisect_right()` to find the index in the `dp` list where the current obstacle height should be inserted. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from typing import List
import bisect

class Solution:
    def longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(self, obstacles: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(obstacles)
        dp = [float('inf')] * n
        ans = [0] * n

        for i in range(n):
            idx = bisect.bisect_right(dp, obstacles[i])
            dp[idx] = obstacles[i]
            ans[i] = idx + 1

        return ans
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition` method with the `obstacles` list as an argument to get the desired output.

Example usage:
```python
sol = Solution()
print(sol.longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition([3,1,5,6,4,2]))
```
This should output `[1,1,2,3,2,2]`, as per the third example in your problem statement.
