Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions.
Here is the problem statement:


You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

 

Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
Example 2:

Input: lists = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
 

Constraints:

k == lists.length
0 <= k <= 10^4
0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4
lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 10^4.

To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the smallest element in each linked list. The algorithm will work as follows:

Add the head node of each linked list to the priority queue.
Remove the smallest element from the priority queue.
Add the next element of the linked list from which the smallest element was removed.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the priority queue is empty.
At each step, we extract the minimum element from the priority queue, which will have a time complexity of O(log k), where k is the number of linked lists. Since we need to process n total nodes, the time complexity of this approach will be O(n log k).

In terms of space complexity, we'll be using the priority queue to store the head of each linked list. Therefore, the space complexity is O(k).

So, the overall time complexity is O(n log k) and space complexity is O(k), where n is the total number of nodes across all linked lists, and k is the number of linked lists.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. 
Here is the function declaration:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

Here is a working Python code that solves the problem using the priority queue approach:

python
Copy code
from typing import List, Optional
from queue import PriorityQueue

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Custom comparator for ListNode objects
        class ListNodeComparator:
            def __init__(self, node):
                self.node = node

            def __lt__(self, other):
                return self.node.val < other.node.val

        # Initialize an empty dummy node and the priority queue
        dummy = ListNode()
        current = dummy
        pq = PriorityQueue()

        # Add the head node of each linked list to the priority queue
        for head in lists:
            if head is not None:
                pq.put(ListNodeComparator(head))

        # Process the priority queue
        while not pq.empty():
            # Get the minimum element and move to the next element in its list
            min_node_comparator = pq.get()
            min_node = min_node_comparator.node
            current.next = min_node
            current = current.next

            if min_node.next is not None:
                pq.put(ListNodeComparator(min_node.next))

        return dummy.next
This code implements the mergeKLists function within the Solution class. It uses a custom comparator for ListNode objects to correctly order them in the priority queue. The main logic of the algorithm is implemented as described in the explanation earlier.
