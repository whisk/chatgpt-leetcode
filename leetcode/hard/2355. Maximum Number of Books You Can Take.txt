Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:

You are given a 0-indexed integer array books of length n where books[i] denotes the number of books on the ith shelf of a bookshelf.

You are going to take books from a contiguous section of the bookshelf spanning from l to r where 0 <= l <= r < n. For each index i in the range l <= i < r, you must take strictly fewer books from shelf i than shelf i + 1.

Return the maximum number of books you can take from the bookshelf.

 

Example 1:

Input: books = [8,5,2,7,9]
Output: 19
Explanation:
- Take 1 book from shelf 1.
- Take 2 books from shelf 2.
- Take 7 books from shelf 3.
- Take 9 books from shelf 4.
You have taken 19 books, so return 19.
It can be proven that 19 is the maximum number of books you can take.
Example 2:

Input: books = [7,0,3,4,5]
Output: 12
Explanation:
- Take 3 books from shelf 2.
- Take 4 books from shelf 3.
- Take 5 books from shelf 4.
You have taken 12 books so return 12.
It can be proven that 12 is the maximum number of books you can take.
Example 3:

Input: books = [8,2,3,7,3,4,0,1,4,3]
Output: 13
Explanation:
- Take 1 book from shelf 0.
- Take 2 books from shelf 1.
- Take 3 books from shelf 2.
- Take 7 books from shelf 3.
You have taken 13 books so return 13.
It can be proven that 13 is the maximum number of books you can take.
 

Constraints:

1 <= books.length <= 10^5
0 <= books[i] <= 10^5

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to build a table where dp[i] represents the maximum number of books that can be taken from the bookshelf ending at the ith shelf.

First, initialize an array dp of length n with all elements set to 0. Then, iterate through the shelves from left to right (i.e., from 0 to n-1). For each shelf i, set dp[i] to books[i] because we can always take all the books from a single shelf. Then, iterate backwards from the current shelf i to the first shelf, and check if the number of books in the previous shelf is strictly less than the current shelf (i.e., books[j] < books[j+1]). If so, update dp[i] by adding the number of books in the previous shelf to the current maximum number of books. After that, update the maximum number of books as max(dp[i], max_books), where max_books is a variable that keeps track of the global maximum number of books.

Finally, return max_books.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) as we need to iterate through the shelves from left to right and also backwards for each shelf. The space complexity is O(n) as we need to store the dynamic programming table.

Pseudocode:

Initialize dp array of size n with all elements set to 0
Initialize max_books variable to 0
For i in 0 to n-1:
a. Set dp[i] to books[i]
b. For j in i-1 to 0 (backwards):
i. If books[j] < books[j+1]:
- Update dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + books[j])
c. Update max_books = max(max_books, dp[i])
Return max_books

The time complexity of your solution seems to be suboptimal. Could you please suggest a more efficient solution?

You're right; the previous solution is suboptimal. Let's try a more efficient approach using two pointers to minimize the number of iterations.

Initialize two pointers, left and right, both starting at 0.

Initialize a variable max_books to store the global maximum number of books, and set it to 0.

Initialize a variable current_books to store the current number of books taken from the shelves.

While right is less than the length of the books array:
a. Add the number of books at the right pointer to current_books.
b. While the constraint "books from the shelf i must be strictly fewer than books from shelf i + 1" is not met, subtract the number of books at the left pointer from current_books and move the left pointer to the right by one.
c. Update max_books as the maximum of max_books and current_books.
d. Move the right pointer to the right by one.

Return max_books.

This solution only iterates through the array once, and the two-pointer approach ensures that we only perform a constant amount of work for each element. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1), as we only use a few variables to store the state of the algorithm.

Here is the pseudocode:

Initialize left, right, max_books, and current_books to 0
While right < len(books):
a. Add books[right] to current_books
b. While constraint is not met:
i. Subtract books[left] from current_books
ii. Move left pointer to the right by one
c. Update max_books = max(max_books, current_books)
d. Move right pointer to the right by one
Return max_books

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
    def maximumBooks(self, books: List[int]) -> int:

Here's the code for the maximumBooks function:

python
Copy code
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumBooks(self, books: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = 0
        max_books = 0
        current_books = 0
        
        while right < len(books):
            current_books += books[right]
            
            while left < right and books[left] >= books[right]:
                current_books -= books[left]
                left += 1
                
            max_books = max(max_books, current_books)
            right += 1
            
        return max_books
This code follows the two-pointer approach discussed earlier, and it should be efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).

This code returns incorrect results. Could you please improve your solution?

Apologies for the confusion. I realize the mistake in the previous code. We need to handle the case where the right pointer encounters a value less than or equal to its previous element. Here's the updated code:

python
Copy code
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumBooks(self, books: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = 0
        max_books = 0
        current_books = 0
        
        while right < len(books):
            current_books += books[right]
            
            while left < right and books[left] >= books[right]:
                current_books -= books[left]
                left += 1
                
            max_books = max(max_books, current_books)
            
            # Handle the case where right pointer encounters a value less than or equal to its previous element
            if right > 0 and books[right] <= books[right - 1]:
                left = right
                current_books = books[right]
                
            right += 1
            
        return max_books
This should now provide correct results for the problem statement. The time complexity remains O(n), and the space complexity is still O(1).
