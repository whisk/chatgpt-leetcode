Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:
You are given an integer n. You roll a fair 6-sided dice n times. Determine the total number of distinct sequences of rolls possible such that the following conditions are satisfied:

The greatest common divisor of any adjacent values in the sequence is equal to 1.
There is at least a gap of 2 rolls between equal valued rolls. More formally, if the value of the ith roll is equal to the value of the jth roll, then abs(i - j) > 2.
Return the total number of distinct sequences possible. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Two sequences are considered distinct if at least one element is different.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 184
Explanation: Some of the possible sequences are (1, 2, 3, 4), (6, 1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3, 1), etc.
Some invalid sequences are (1, 2, 1, 3), (1, 2, 3, 6).
(1, 2, 1, 3) is invalid since the first and third roll have an equal value and abs(1 - 3) = 2 (i and j are 1-indexed).
(1, 2, 3, 6) is invalid since the greatest common divisor of 3 and 6 = 3.
There are a total of 184 distinct sequences possible, so we return 184.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: 22
Explanation: Some of the possible sequences are (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2).
Some invalid sequences are (3, 6), (2, 4) since the greatest common divisor is not equal to 1.
There are a total of 22 distinct sequences possible, so we return 22.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^4

The most efficient solution to this problem can be achieved using dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track of the state of the last two rolls and the current roll, and update the number of valid sequences accordingly.

Let's define a 3D array dp[i][j][k], where i is the current roll (0-indexed), j is the value of the previous roll, and k is the value of the roll before the previous one. The array dp[i][j][k] will store the number of valid sequences ending with the ith roll having value j and the (i-1)th roll having value k.

First, initialize the dp array with 0.

Now, iterate through all possible rolls from i = 0 to n - 1, and for each roll, iterate through all possible values for j and k from 1 to 6. For each combination of i, j, and k, iterate through all possible dice values d (1 to 6) and update the dp array as follows:

1. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of j and d is equal to 1, and d is not equal to k, increment dp[i][d][j] by dp[i-1][j][k].
2. To handle the case when i = 0, if GCD of j and d is equal to 1, increment dp[i][d][j] by 1.

After iterating through all the possible values of i, j, k, and d, the answer will be the sum of all elements in dp[n-1][j][k] for all values of j and k from 1 to 6. Finally, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * 6^3) = O(216n) since we are iterating through all combinations of i, j, k, and d. The space complexity is also O(n * 6^2) = O(36n) as we need to store the dp array for each roll and each combination of j and k.

In the given constraints, n can go up to 10^4, so this solution should be efficient enough for the problem.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
    def distinctSequences(self, n: int) -> int:

Here's a Python implementation of the solution using the dynamic programming approach I previously explained:

```python
class Solution:
    def distinctSequences(self, n: int) -> int:
        from math import gcd

        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        # Initialize the dp array
        dp = [[[0] * 7 for _ in range(7)] for _ in range(n)]

        # Iterate through all possible rolls, previous roll values, and roll before previous values
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(1, 7):
                for k in range(1, 7):
                    for d in range(1, 7):
                        # If the GCD of j and d is equal to 1, and d is not equal to k
                        if gcd(j, d) == 1 and d != k:
                            # Update the dp array
                            if i == 0:
                                dp[i][d][j] += 1
                            else:
                                dp[i][d][j] += dp[i - 1][j][k]
                            dp[i][d][j] %= MOD

        # Calculate the answer as the sum of all elements in dp[n-1][j][k]
        ans = 0
        for j in range(1, 7):
            for k in range(1, 7):
                ans += dp[n - 1][j][k]
                ans %= MOD

        return ans
```

You can use this code to solve the problem. It follows the dynamic programming approach and uses a 3D array to store intermediate results. The code has a time complexity of O(216n) and a space complexity of O(36n).

This code returns incorrect results. Could you please improve your solution?

I apologize for the confusion. I realize that I made a mistake in the implementation. Here's an improved version of the solution using dynamic programming:

```python
class Solution:
    def distinctSequences(self, n: int) -> int:
        from math import gcd

        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        # Initialize the dp array
        dp = [[[0] * 8 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(n)]

        # Iterate through all possible rolls, previous roll values, and roll before previous values
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(1, 7):
                for k in range(1, 7):
                    for d in range(1, 7):
                        # If the GCD of j and d is equal to 1, and d is not equal to k
                        if gcd(j, d) == 1 and d != k:
                            # Update the dp array
                            if i == 0:
                                dp[i][d][j] = 1
                            else:
                                dp[i][d][j] += dp[i - 1][j][k]
                                dp[i][d][j] %= MOD

        # Calculate the answer as the sum of all elements in dp[n-1][j][k]
        ans = 0
        for j in range(1, 7):
            for k in range(1, 7):
                ans += dp[n - 1][j][k]
                ans %= MOD

        return ans
```

This corrected version initializes dp[i][d][j] to 1 when i == 0, rather than incrementing it by 1. The code has a time complexity of O(216n) and a space complexity of O(36n).
