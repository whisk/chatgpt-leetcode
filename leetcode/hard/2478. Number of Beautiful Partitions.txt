Hi, this is a coding interview. I will give you a problem statement and expect that you explain the idea of the most efficient solution. You should estimate time and memory complexity using the big O notation. You don't need to write code yet. Feel free to ask clarifying questions. Here is the problem statement:
You are given a string s that consists of the digits '1' to '9' and two integers k and minLength.

A partition of s is called beautiful if:

s is partitioned into k non-intersecting substrings.
Each substring has a length of at least minLength.
Each substring starts with a prime digit and ends with a non-prime digit. Prime digits are '2', '3', '5', and '7', and the rest of the digits are non-prime.
Return the number of beautiful partitions of s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "23542185131", k = 3, minLength = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: There exists three ways to create a beautiful partition:
"2354 | 218 | 5131"
"2354 | 21851 | 31"
"2354218 | 51 | 31"
Example 2:

Input: s = "23542185131", k = 3, minLength = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: There exists one way to create a beautiful partition: "2354 | 218 | 5131".
Example 3:

Input: s = "3312958", k = 3, minLength = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: There exists one way to create a beautiful partition: "331 | 29 | 58".
 

Constraints:

1 <= k, minLength <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of the digits '1' to '9'.

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a 2D DP array dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the number of beautiful partitions of s up to index i with j partitions. We can initialize the DP array with all zeros except for dp[0][0] which should be 1 (as there is only one way to partition an empty string into 0 parts).

Now, we need to iterate through the string s, and for each index i, we will iterate through the possible partitions from 1 to k. For each partition j, we will iterate through the possible lengths of the last substring in the partition. We can start this iteration from minLength and go up to the length of the remaining string. If the substring starts with a prime digit and ends with a non-prime digit, we can add the number of beautiful partitions up to the previous index (i - currentLength) with (j - 1) partitions to dp[i][j].

After filling up the DP array, the answer will be stored in dp[s.length()][k]. Since the answer can be very large, we need to take modulo 10^9 + 7 during each addition step.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * k * minLength), where n is the length of the string s. This is because we have three nested loops: the first one iterating through the string (n), the second one iterating through the possible partitions (k), and the third one iterating through the possible lengths of the last substring in the partition (minLength).

The space complexity is O(n * k), which is the size of the DP array.

Please write a working code for this problem in Python. I will give you an empty function declaration, and you should expand it with your code. Please remember, that you should not change function definition. Here is the function declaration:
    def beautifulPartitions(self, s: str, k: int, minLength: int) -> int:

Here's the implementation of the beautifulPartitions function based on the dynamic programming approach explained earlier:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def beautifulPartitions(self, s: str, k: int, minLength: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        n = len(s)

        # Initialize DP array
        dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1

        # Helper function to check if a digit is prime
        def is_prime(digit: str) -> bool:
            return digit in {'2', '3', '5', '7'}

        # Iterate through the string s
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, k + 1):
                for length in range(minLength, i - j + 2):
                    # Check if the substring starts with a prime digit and ends with a non-prime digit
                    if is_prime(s[i - length]) and not is_prime(s[i - 1]):
                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - length][j - 1]) % MOD

        return dp[n][k]
This implementation follows the dynamic programming approach explained earlier, and it has the same time and space complexity: O(n^2 * k * minLength) and O(n * k), respectively.

This code runs too long or hangs. Could you please improve it?

I apologize for the confusion. I can see how the solution may become slow for larger inputs. Let's optimize the solution by utilizing prefix sums to avoid the innermost loop. This way, we can precompute the sums of the DP array up to a certain index and use that information to update the DP array faster.

Here's the optimized version of the beautifulPartitions function:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def beautifulPartitions(self, s: str, k: int, minLength: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        n = len(s)

        # Initialize DP array and prefix sum array
        dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        prefix_sum = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        prefix_sum[0][0] = 1

        # Helper function to check if a digit is prime
        def is_prime(digit: str) -> bool:
            return digit in {'2', '3', '5', '7'}

        # Iterate through the string s
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, k + 1):
                if i >= minLength and is_prime(s[i - minLength]) and not is_prime(s[i - 1]):
                    dp[i][j] = (prefix_sum[i - minLength][j - 1] - prefix_sum[max(0, i - minLength - j)][j - 1] + MOD) % MOD

                # Update the prefix sum array
                prefix_sum[i][j] = (prefix_sum[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j]) % MOD

        return dp[n][k]
By using prefix sums, we have eliminated the innermost loop, reducing the time complexity to O(n * k), which should make the code significantly faster for larger inputs. The space complexity remains O(n * k).
