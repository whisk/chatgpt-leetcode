# chatgpt-leetcode

## Plan and explanations

Problems were chosen randomly. A problem was dismissed and next one is chosen, if:
* problem's description contains images (can't give image to ChatGPT)
* problem has more downvotes than upvotes (problem has low quality)
* problem were added on September 2021 (unsure if it was published before or after ChatGPT's cut date)
* problem has medium difficulty (some medium problems are easy, some of them are hard)
* problem is an SQL problem

52 problems were chosen in total:
* 13 easy published before September 2021
* 13 hard published before September 2021
* 13 easy published after September 2021
* 13 hard published after September 2021

ChatGPT-4 was used in all cases.

All dialogues were following the same pattern:
- intro and problem statement, request for solution without code
- (optional) prompt to correct the solution if it's obviously suboptimal
- ask for working code in python, starting with given function declaration
- (optional) prompt to fix the code if it doesn't pass tests

All dialogues had strictly the same wording. See `phrases.txt` for specific templates.
